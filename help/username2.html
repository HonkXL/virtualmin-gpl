<header>Username</header>

This field is for entering the first part of the user's login,
which must be unique within the domain. The user's login name for
FTP will be based on whatever is entered in this field. For example,
if the username is <tt>user1</tt> and the domain <tt>example.com</tt>,
the FTP login would typically become <tt>user1-example</tt>. <p>

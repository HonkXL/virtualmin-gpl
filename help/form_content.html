<header>Create initial web page?</header>

To create an initial webpage for the new virtual server, you can choose to have
no webpage created by selecting "No", or opt for a <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.virtualmin.com/docs/server-components/website-default-page/">default 
landing page </a> by choosing "Yes, with the default landing page
template", which generates a basic page indicating the virtual server is ready.
Alternatively, selecting "Yes, with content below" allows you to input custom
HTML or text to be used as the webpage content. <p>

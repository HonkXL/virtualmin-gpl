<header>PHP process manager mode</header>
PHP-FPM, or FastCGI Process Manager for PHP, provides several management
modes for its worker processes. These modes determine how PHP-FPM will
create, maintain, and recycle the child processes that handle PHP requests.
The mode is set using the <tt>pm</tt> configuration directive.<br>

<br>
<b><tt>dynamic</tt></b> (default)<br>
In the <tt>dynamic</tt> mode, PHP-FPM dynamically adjusts the number of spawned
child processes based on the demand. Benefits include automatic adjustment
of the number of child processes based on demand, ensuring optimal resource
utilization. This is especially useful for servers with fluctuating loads.<br>

<br>
<b><tt>static</tt></b><br>
In the <tt>static</tt> mode, PHP-FPM maintains a fixed number of child processes.
This number is specified by the <tt>pm.max_children</tt> directive. Benefits include
consistent memory usage due to a constant number of child processes. This is ideal
for servers with stable loads.<br>

<br>
<b><tt>ondemand</tt></b><br>
In the <tt>ondemand</tt> mode, PHP-FPM spawns child processes only when they are needed,
i.e., when there's an incoming request that needs processing. Processes are then terminated
after being idle for a specified amount of time by the <tt>pm.process_idle_timeout</tt>
directive. Benefits include reduced memory usage during periods of low or no traffic.
Ideal for servers with intermittent loads or applications with unpredictable traffic
patterns.<br>

<br>
The best mode for your application may vary based on the server's available resources, traffic
patterns, and specific application characteristics. It's essential to monitor and fine-tune the
settings to achieve optimal performance.

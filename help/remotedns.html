<header>Remote DNS Servers</header>

This page allows you to register systems running Webmin as DNS servers so that
zones can be hosted on them rather than your primary Virtualmin system. Any
systems added must already be running BIND and have the DNS DNS Server module
in Webmin configured correctly. <p>

Once added, DNS zones can be moved to or created on the remote systems. It is
also possible to use only remote DNS, and shut down the BIND server on this
system to save memory. <p>

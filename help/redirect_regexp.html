<header>Include sub-paths in redirect?</header>

When this option is set to <b>No,</b> any sub-directory or filename under the source
URL path will <em>not</em> be appended to the redirect. For instance, redirecting
from <tt>/google</tt> to <tt>http://google.com</tt> means that accessing <tt>http://example.com/something</tt>
will lead you directly to <tt>http://google.com,</tt> without including the <tt>/something</tt> part.
<p></p>
On the other hand, if you choose <b>Yes,</b> and a browser accesses <tt>http://example.com/something,</tt>
the resulting URL would be <tt>http://google.com/something.</tt> However, this inclusion
requires the placement of the special code <tt>$1</tt> in the destination URL, representing
the sub-path or filename that follows the source URL path.

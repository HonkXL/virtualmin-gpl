<header>Maximum allowed aliases</header>

This field sets a limit on the number of aliases that can be created by this server owner.
This limit is often used in conjunction with the <em>Maximum allowed sub-servers</em> to
give a user permissions to create a higher or unlimited number of aliases for his domains,
while still limiting the number of sub-servers. <p>

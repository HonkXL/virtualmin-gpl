<header>Alias DNS domains have their own records?</header>

By default alias domains always have their DNS records copied from the target
domain, and so cannot be edited separately. Changing this option to <b>Yes</b>
gives newly created alias domains their own independent set of records. However,
this is not recommended for most users. <p>

<header>Create host default domain with Let's Encrypt certificate?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b>, Virtualmin will automatically attempt to
create a hidden host default domain (virtual server) with a Let's Encrypt
certificate during the next configuration check. If the Let's Encrypt
certificate cannot be successfully requested for the system hostname,
the host default domain will be automatically removed.

<p></p>
However, it is possible to use <b>Yes, and keep visible,</b> option to keep
host default domain visible, and not have it removed in case Let's Encrypt
certificate cannot be requested successfully, which will allow for manual
adjustments later on.

<p></p>
If the system's hostname changes, Virtualmin will automatically try to
update host default domain name accordingly on the next configuration
check.

<p></p>
Host default domain can be disabled by setting this option to <b>No,</b>
which will make it to be removed from the system on the next configuration
check.

<p></p>
Be advised that using host default domain for mail is highly discouraged,
and may cause problems with mail delivery!

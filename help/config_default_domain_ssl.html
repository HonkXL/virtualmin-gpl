<header>Create host default domain with Let's Encrypt certificate?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes,</b> Virtualmin will attempt to create
hidden host default domain (virtual server) with Let's Encrypt certificate
on the next configuration check. If Let's Encrypt certificate cannot be
requested successfully for the system hostname, it will be automatically
deleted.

<p></p>
However, it is possible to use <b>Yes, and keep visible,</b> option to keep
host default domain visible, and not have it removed in case Let's Encrypt
certificate cannot be requested successfully, which will allow for manual
adjustments later on.

<p></p>
If the system's hostname changes, Virtualmin will automatically try to
update host default domain name accordingly on the next configuration
check.

<p></p>
Host default domain can be disabled by setting this option to <b>No,</b>
which will make it to be removed from the system on the next configuration
check.

<p></p>
Be advised that using host default domain for mail is highly discouraged,
and may cause problems with mail delivery!

<header>PHP service maximum sub-processes</header>

This option sets the limit on the number of simultaneous requests that will be served,
when PHP scripts for this domain setup to run via FPM, the number of child processes
will be created when <tt>pm</tt> option is set to <tt>static</tt> and the maximum number of
child processes could potentially be created when <tt>pm</tt> option is set to <tt>dynamic</tt>.
The number of maximum sub-processes cannot be lower than 5, unless default <tt>pm.max_spare_servers</tt>
option value is also manually decreased. Setting this option to <em>Unlimited</em> is strongly not
recommended when run in FPM mode.<p>

When PHP scripts for this domain setup to run via FCGId, the number of PHP
processes set in this field will be kept running at all times to serve
requests. You can increase this from the default of 20 to improve PHP script
latency, or decrease it to reduce memory use. Setting it to <em>Unlimited</em>
in FCGId mode will cause PHP processes to be launched only as needed on demand,
and to be cleaned up after some period of inactivity.<p>

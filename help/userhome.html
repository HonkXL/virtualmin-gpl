<header>Home directory</header>

This field allows you to choose a custom home directory for a mailbox user. For
example, you might want their home directory to be under the
`<tt>public_html</tt>` directory, so they can easily create web files. However,
in most cases, it should be set to <b>>Automatic</b>. <p>
